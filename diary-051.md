# This course

The course - Introduce to DevOps as its name, provides an introduction to DevOps by covering both
related technologies and software development pratices.	
Through this course, I expect to learn something new:

* Definition of DevOps and is it suitable for me to follow DevOps
* Advantage of DepOps approach.
* Culture, thinking of DevOps and the difference of DevOps with orther development approaches.
* Stages of DepOps.
* DevOps tools involved development and delivery process
* Learn to use some tools involved DevOps

# Learning
* DevOps is a set of pratices intended to reduce the time beween commiting a change to a system and the change being placed into normal production, while ensuring high quality. A process incluses: coding,
building, testing, packaging, releasing, configuring and monitoring.

* Through the material, the main principles of DevOps are automation, continuous delivery, and fast reaction to feedback. As CAMS model:
..* Culture represented by human communication, technical processes, and tools
..* Automation of processes
..* Measurement of KPIs
..* Sharing feedback, best practices, and knowledge 
* During this course, through practical project, I have reviewed my knowledge about HTML, Markdown markup language and practiced using GitHub.
* In addition, it is chance to try GitHub pages, that I never used before. Besides that, I also understand more about version control system with repositories for source code management that enables working online and offline.
* This course also provide knowledge about CI/CD for me and why is is necsessary in recently.
..* Continous Integration: is the practice of quickly integrating newly developed code with the main body of code that is to be released. Continuous integration saves a lot of time when the team is ready to release the code.The continuous integration process from a DevOps perspective involves checking your code in, compiling it into usable (often binary executable) code and running some basic validation testing.
..* Continous Delivery: Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration. When executing continuous delivery, you add additional automation and testing so that you don’t just merge the code with the main code line frequently, but you get the code nearly ready to deploy with almost no human intervention.
..* Continous Deployment: s the most advanced evolution of continuous delivery. It’s the practice of deploying all the way into production without any human intervention. The code release typically only goes to a small percentage of users and there’s an automated feedback loop that monitors quality and usage before the code is propagated further.
* It will build the fundamental knowledge for me to learn and take part in another courses and projects.
