	<p>
	My name is Loc Hoang. I am following Bachelor of Engineer Degree in Information Technology.
	Besides that, as a curious person and the interest in computer, I have paid effort on learning by myself in some programming languages that are attractive and trending now.
	I have learned Python, Java, PHP, Android development (in both Java and Kotlin).
	During the process, I realize that I have a passion to work with data, algorithms in combine with coding and using computer.
	Undoubted, it will be fantastic that among an ocean of data, we can find something useful, convert it into valuable findings and conveys to the other.
	Consequently, I want to learn and apply Machine Learning/ Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligent to solve real world problems for example in industries, mechanic, business, health or other involved technologies.
